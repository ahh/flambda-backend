Warning 186 [inferred-nontail-in-tcod-cycle]: This function
call was inferred as nontail, but it may participate in a
cycle of TCO'd tail calls, which could overflow the stack at
runtime. Consider marking the function call with [@tail].

Here is one such cycle:

    file "caller_cu.ml", line 14, characters 2-63: calls (in inferred nontail position)
 -> [camlCalled_cu__tailcalls_arg_0_2_code], which (possibly transitively) tailcalls <unknown target>
 -> <unknown target>
